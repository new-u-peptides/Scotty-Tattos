# Scotty-Tattos — two sites in one repo

This repository hosts the source for two related but independently
deployable static sites:

| Path           | Live as              | Description                                                                          |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `./` (root)    | **scottymassa.com**  | Scotty Massa's personal portfolio. Tattoo artist working out of Birkirkara, Malta, travelling worldwide. |
| `massatattoo/` | **massatattoo.com**  | The Massa Tattoo studio site. Six pages: Home, About, Portfolio, Blog, Testimonials, Contact. |

Each site is self-contained — its own pages, assets, and (where applicable)
partials. The two sites can be split into separate repositories at any time
with `git filter-repo`.

```

Both sites load the shared JS modules from `shared/js/...` (scotty
root) or `../shared/js/...` (massatattoo). For production, each
deployment must include `shared/` above its own site root — see
`shared/README.md` for the long version.

---

## Quick start

Both sites are pure HTML/CSS/JS — no build step. The studio site
(`massatattoo/`) uses `fetch()` to load header/footer partials, so it must
be served over HTTP, not opened as `file://`.

```bash
# Serve the whole monorepo
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then visit:
#   http://localhost:8000/             → scottymassa.com
#   http://localhost:8000/massatattoo/ → massatattoo.com
```

For a sharper local approximation of production (one site per port):

```bash
# In two separate terminals:
python3 -m http.server 8001           # scottymassa.com (root)
(cd massatattoo && python3 -m http.server 8002)  # massatattoo.com
```

---

## scottymassa.com (root)

Single-artist personal portfolio. Plain HTML + CSS + a small `main.js`.
No build step.

- **Pages** — Home, About, Portfolio, Tour, Booking, Aftercare, Contact.
- **Palette** — ink black, bone white, rust red, antique gold.
- **Type** — Cinzel (display) · Inter (body) · Tangerine (script accents).
- **Components** — sticky nav, hero, marquee, 12-col portfolio grid,
  style cards, tour list, stats, quote, CTA block, footer.
- **Animation** — reveal-on-scroll via `IntersectionObserver`.

Drop real photography into `assets/images/` and lift the design into
Next.js / Astro / WordPress later if needed.

---

## Booking flow (scottymassa.com)

Two steps, per `docs` discussion with Scotty on how premium enquiries should
be filtered before they reach his calendar:

1. **`booking.html`** — name + email, plus a *separate, unticked* checkbox
   for general marketing (guest spots/travel/flash/conventions). Posts to
   `api/booking-lead.js`, which emails the client the process/pricing brief
   and pings the studio inbox, then redirects to `booking-thank-you.html`.
2. **`booking-thank-you.html`** — offers both paths: jump straight into
   `booking-application.html` now, or wait for the process email and come
   back later. Either way the lead is already captured.
3. **`booking-application.html`** — the full structured application
   (origin, placement, scale, concept, reference images, body-area photos,
   18+ / photo-ID / pricing acknowledgements). Posts multipart form data to
   `api/booking-application.js`, which emails the complete application
   (with attachments) to the studio inbox and confirms receipt to the
   client. Lands on `booking-application-received.html`.

`privacy.html` documents what's collected and why, and is linked from both
forms and the footer.

**Email** is sent via [Resend](https://resend.com) (`api/_lib/email.js`,
a plain `fetch` wrapper — no SDK dependency). Configure `RESEND_API_KEY`,
`RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` and `BOOKING_NOTIFY_EMAIL` as Vercel project env vars —
see `.env.example`.

**File uploads** go straight through the serverless function as email
attachments (no object storage yet) — capped client- and server-side at
2MB/file, 3 files per field, ~4MB combined, to stay under Vercel's request
body limit. If that turns out to be too tight in practice, the fix is
switching to direct-to-[Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob)
client uploads rather than raising the cap.

### Deliberately not built yet

This pass is front-end + email-relay only. Scotty separately sketched a
much larger system (CRM-style lead states, lead scoring, a review
dashboard, Calendly + Google Calendar, Stripe deposits, an automated
training funnel) — all of it is sound direction, but each piece needs
either a real third-party account (Calendly, Stripe, an ESP like AWeber)
or an infrastructure decision (which database, which auth) that's out of
scope for a static-site PR. Treat this as Phase 1: every enquiry still
reaches the studio inbox and every Step-1 lead still gets captured (via
the internal notification email), just without persistence, scoring, or
automation beyond the two transactional emails above.

---

## massatattoo.com (`massatattoo/`)

The Massa Tattoo studio brand — multi-artist, six pages, partial-based
chrome.

- **Pages** — Home, About, Portfolio, Blog, Testimonials, Contact.
- **Palette** — warm paper/beige base, gold accent.
- **Type** — Cormorant Garamond (display) · Inter (body) · JetBrains Mono (mono).
- **Partial includes** — `<div data-include="partials/header.html"></div>`
  placeholders are replaced at runtime by `assets/js/includes.js`. Set
  `data-nav-current="<page>"` on `<body>` and the matching nav link gets
  the `is-active` class.
- **No frameworks, no bundler.** Flat directory of static files.

---

## Deploying as two sites

### Option A — two projects, one repo
Most static hosts let you point a domain at a subdirectory:
- **Netlify / Vercel / Cloudflare Pages** — create two projects from
  this repo. One has publish dir `./`, the other `./massatattoo/`. Point
  scottymassa.com at the first, massatattoo.com at the second.
- **GitHub Pages** — not directly supported per-subdirectory; use Option B.

### Option B — split into two repositories
When the sites diverge enough to warrant separate history:

```bash
# Studio site → its own repo
git clone <this-repo> massatattoo-split && cd massatattoo-split
git filter-repo --subdirectory-filter massatattoo
git remote add origin <new-massatattoo-repo>
git push -u origin main
```

The root scottymassa.com files can stay in this repo, or be split out
similarly with `git filter-repo --path <file> --invert-paths` to remove
`massatattoo/` and keep the root files.

---

## Editing & adding pages

### scottymassa.com (root)
1. Add a new `<page>.html` at the repo root.
2. Update the nav links at the top of every other root-level page.

### massatattoo.com (`massatattoo/`)
1. Add a new `massatattoo/<page>.html`.
2. Drop in the two `data-include` placeholders and load `includes.js`.
3. Set `data-nav-current` on `<body>` to one of the nav slugs.
4. Update `massatattoo/partials/header.html` and `footer.html` if the
   page should appear in nav.

---

## Photography

The first batch of photos is now wired into both sites:
- 6 tattoo pieces across both portfolios + featured-work grids
- 4 studio interior shots in About / Aftercare / split-media blocks
- 2 Scotty working portraits + 2 B&W lifestyle / atmospheric shots
  (the B&W chair shot is the scottymassa.com hero backdrop)

To add more: drop new files into `/public/` on the
`claude/keen-rubin-DMDXL-design` branch (or any branch) and I'll sort,
rename, optimise, and wire them in. The image asset layout is:

```
assets/images/                          ← scottymassa.com
├── tattoos/    chest-mandala.jpg, leg-sleeve-mandala.jpg, …
├── artist/     scotty-tattooing.jpg, portrait-bw-chair.webp, …
└── studio/     entrance-lounge.webp, treatment-room.jpg, …

massatattoo/assets/images/              ← massatattoo.com (same layout)
```

### Still-wanted shots

- **More Scotty portraits** — the current set is two working shots and
  two B&W lifestyle frames. We could use: a clean studio headshot, a wide
  environmental (full body, studio behind), a hands / detail shot, a
  candid lifestyle / on-tour shot.
- **3 distinct team portraits** for massatattoo.com — Massa (founder),
  Iris (resident dotwork), Tomas (resident fine-line). Currently the
  team grid still shows SVG illustrations because we can't mix-and-match
  1 photo with 2 SVGs without it looking lopsided.
- **More tattoo work** — particularly traditional / Japanese / colour
  pieces if Scotty has them, to broaden the portfolio beyond mandala /
  dotwork.
- **Tour city photos** — one per upcoming city for `tour.html` (optional).

## Browser support

Targets the last two versions of evergreen browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox,
Safari). Key gates: CSS custom properties, `clip-path: polygon()`,
`aspect-ratio`, `grid`, `fetch`, `Promise.all`, `IntersectionObserver`.

---

## Contributing

- Branch off `main` with `feat/...`, `fix/...`, or `claude/...-<id>` for
  Claude Code sessions.
- Keep each PR scoped to **one site** when possible. Say so in the PR
  description if it has to touch both.
- QA both sites locally with `python3 -m http.server` before opening.

---

## Roadmap

- [x] scottymassa.com — design files in place (pages, styles, JS).
- [x] massatattoo.com — six pages built in `massatattoo/`.
- [x] Hoist `main.js`, `mandala.js`, `includes.js` into the `shared/` tree.
- [x] Lotus-petal arches woven into the mandala animation.
- [x] Open Graph + Twitter Card meta, canonical and favicon on every page.
- [x] Alpha tokens (`--bone-12`, `--gold-15`, etc.) replace literal `rgba()`.
- [x] 880–980 px tightening on massatattoo so the layout doesn't read airless once the nav collapses.
- [ ] Drop real photography into `assets/images/` (scottymassa) and
      replace SVG placeholders in `massatattoo/portfolio.html`.
- [x] Wire scottymassa.com's booking flow to a real submission endpoint
      (see "Booking flow" below). `massatattoo/contact.html`'s booking form
      is still a client-side stub — not in scope for this pass.
- [ ] Per-site `sitemap.xml` for massatattoo (scottymassa already has one).
- [ ] Lighthouse pass on both sites — target 100/100/100/100.
- [ ] When ready, split into two GitHub repositories.
